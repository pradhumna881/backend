  " To observe how our thoughts work, and why I trap myself in painful thought patterns—stuck in cycles that make life feel unbearable—and to clearly experience this process, please follow these steps:",

"1.Set an alarm for 5 minutes.",

"2.Sit comfortably in a quiet place.",

"3.Close your eyes gently.",

"4.Bring your attention to your breathing.",

"a.Notice the air coming in as you inhale.",

"b. Notice the air going out as you exhale.",

"c. Feel how the air touches your nostrils — the coolness as you breathe in, the warmth as you breathe out.",

"5.Stay focused on your breath, in and out.",

"6.If your mind wanders, gently bring your focus back to your breath until the alarm rings.",

"Even in just five minutes, you’ll notice that your mind rarely stays focused and only wanders in two directions—the past or the future. It jumps to the past: if the memories are good, you feel happy; if they are bad, you feel sad or anxious. Then it jumps to the future: imagining positive events makes you feel excited, while imagining negative ones makes you feel worried or anxious.",

"The truth is, the past is already over. No matter how much money or effort you spend—even billions or trillions—you cannot bring back a single second of it. The future hasn’t arrived yet, and when it does, it will become the present. The present is the only time you can truly live in. notice how our habit patterns are formed by mind. What really matters is what you are doing right now.",

"These things cannot be truly understood by just reading. Reading only reaches the surface of the mind, while the deeper mind remains the same. Real change happens only when you practice mindfulness daily—at least 15 minutes of focusing on your breath. By simply observing your breath, you train your mind to live in the present. Every time your mind drifts, gently bring it back without getting angry or frustrated about why it slipped. This strengthens the ‘muscle’ of your attention. Practicing this regularly breaks the habit of your mind jumping mindlessly between the past and the future.",

"Here are some tips to help you break the habit of overthinking:",

"1.set a daily worry time:",

"Set a daily “worry time.” Choose a fixed time each day, for example, 15–30 minutes, to let yourself worry. When worries arise at other times, write them down and remind yourself, “I’ll think about this during my worry time.” This practice keeps worries from taking over your entire day and teaches your mind to respect those boundaries.",

"2.write your thoughts on paper:",

"Write your thoughts down on paper. After writing, review them carefully: Which thoughts are useful, and which are just automatic, meaningless, or silly? Cross out the useless or silly thoughts, and focus only on the useful ones—the thoughts you can actually work on and do something about.",

"3.change negative thoughts to positive :",

"Catch negative thoughts and ask yourself, “Can I see this differently?” Instead of thinking, “I always fail,” try to replace it with, “Everyone makes mistakes, I can improve.” Positive thinking reduces stress and helps you take better action in the present moment.",

"4.stay active and engaged:",

"Keep your mind busy with healthy activities. Study something new, talk with friends, and engage in activities like painting, sports, or gardening that keep your mind occupied. When you stay busy, your mind has less time to wander into unhelpful patterns. Spend time on things that truly bring you joy and meaning—hobbies, creative work, helping others, learning new skills, or simply being with friends. The more you do what makes you genuinely happy, the lighter your mind feels, and the less it overthinks",

"5.How to Deal with Your Thoughts:",

"You cannot live in the past or the future. Only the present is real, so focus on now to feel more at peace. Don’t stress about automatic thoughts. Let them come and go and don’t make them bigger by worrying about them. Take action on thoughts that matter; if a thought is about something real and important, do something about it. Stay connected and active, as healthy friendships, conversations, and meaningful activities help break the habit of unhelpful thinking.",

"If you practice these steps consistently, slowly but surely, you will break free from the habit of overthinking and start living in the present moment with peace and clarity. "
